- Express.js for backend API
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL driver
- Neon Database for serverless PostgreSQL

### SEO-Specific Integrations
- **OpenAI API**: Content analysis, optimization suggestions, and automated content generation
- **Puppeteer**: Web scraping for technical audits and competitor analysis
- **External SEO APIs**: Planned integration for keyword data and backlink metrics

### UI and Development Tools
- Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- TypeScript for type safety across the stack

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: Vite development server with hot module replacement
- **Backend**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development
- **Database**: Environment variable configuration for database connections

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code for Node.js deployment
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations handle schema deployment
- **Environment**: Replit-optimized with runtime error handling

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend via `/shared` directory
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with Drizzle's type-safe database queries
3. **Modern React Patterns**: Function components with hooks, avoiding class components
4. **Serverless Database**: Neon PostgreSQL chosen for scalability and developer experience
5. **Component Library**: Shadcn/ui selected for consistent, accessible UI components
6. **Build Optimization**: Separate build processes for client and server with optimal bundling

The application is designed to be a comprehensive SEO automation platform that can scale from individual users to agency-level usage, with a focus on automation while maintaining human oversight and control.
