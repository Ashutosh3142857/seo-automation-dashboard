## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight client-side routing)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/ui component library
- **Build Tool**: Vite with TypeScript support
- **Component Structure**: Modular design with reusable UI components

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API design
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon Database)
- **External Services**: OpenAI API integration for content analysis and generation

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **Schema**: Comprehensive SEO-focused database schema including:
  - Users and websites management
  - Keywords tracking with position history
  - Backlinks management and status tracking
  - Content analysis and optimization suggestions
  - Technical audit results storage
  - Local SEO data and competitor analysis
- **Migrations**: Drizzle-based migration system
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with WebSocket support

### API Services
- **SEO Services**: Technical audit automation using Puppeteer
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI-powered content optimization and analysis
- **Backlink Discovery**: Automated backlink opportunity identification
- **Rank Tracking**: SERP position monitoring and historical tracking

### User Interface Components
- **Dashboard**: Overview with key metrics and performance charts
- **Tool Grid**: Quick access to all SEO tools with status indicators
- **Specialized Pages**: Dedicated interfaces for each SEO function
- **Charts**: Custom Chart.js integration for data visualization

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with React frontend components
2. **API Requests**: TanStack Query manages API calls to Express backend
3. **Service Layer**: Backend services process requests and integrate with external APIs
4. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM handles all database interactions
5. **Real-time Updates**: Query invalidation ensures UI stays synchronized

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- React ecosystem (React, ReactDOM, React Query)
- Express.js for backend API
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL driver
- Neon Database for serverless PostgreSQL

### SEO-Specific Integrations
- **OpenAI API**: Content analysis, optimization suggestions, and automated content generation
- **Puppeteer**: Web scraping for technical audits and competitor analysis
- **External SEO APIs**: Planned integration for keyword data and backlink metrics

### UI and Development Tools
- Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- TypeScript for type safety across the stack

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: Vite development server with hot module replacement
- **Backend**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development
- **Database**: Environment variable configuration for database connections

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code for Node.js deployment
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations handle schema deployment
- **Environment**: Replit-optimized with runtime error handling

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend via `/shared` directory
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with Drizzle's type-safe database queries
3. **Modern React Patterns**: Function components with hooks, avoiding class components
4. **Serverless Database**: Neon PostgreSQL chosen for scalability and developer experience
5. **Component Library**: Shadcn/ui selected for consistent, accessible UI components
6. **Build Optimization**: Separate build processes for client and server with optimal bundling

The application is designed to be a comprehensive SEO automation platform that can scale from individual users to agency-level usage, with a focus on automation while maintaining human oversight and control.
